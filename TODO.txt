At some point in time, this SHOULD be the readme. It isn't right now, obviously.

===============================================================================
SHELLTUBE                                    Shell scripts for easy YT-browsing
===============================================================================
shelltube is a collection of (pretty POSIX) shell scripts to
browse YouTube quickly, and entirely without captive UIs.

shellTube is written in pure shell; its only dependencies
are any modern shell (pdksh, bash, zsh) and curl/wget/ftp.
Your terminal should accept ANSI color-codes, too~



----------------------------------------
USAGE
----------------------------------------
There are three different scripts that make up shelltube:
	* yt-search
	* yt-channel
	* yt-meta

In all three scripts:
	'index' means what page of results you're on--
	'results' means how many of them will be displayed.

yt-search lists videos matching a certain search query.
	USAGE: yt-search [-i index] [-r results] query


yt-channel lists the videos of a given channel.
	USAGE: yt-channel [-i index] [-r results] URL/ID/name

yt-meta lists the metadata of a given video
	USAGE: yt-meta URL/ID
